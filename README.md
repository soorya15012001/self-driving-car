# self-driving-car

This repository is to simulate a self driving car 
to run the code properly one must have udacity car simulator application and all the required libraries which you can see in the codes.
firstly,collect data using the udacity car simulator and store the .csv and IMG file in same folder named data along with the above codes.
run the model.py
after successfully building and training the model you can see few epoch files
run drive.py model-001.h5 when the simulator is in autonomous mode
If everything was correct you can now see the car moving.
